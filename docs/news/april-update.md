# ðŸ†• April Update

## 1. Native scroll-driven animations

Webstudio leverages the new Scroll Timeline API, allowing browsers to synchronize scrolling with content at native performance levels. For browsers that don't support this feature, we use a polyfill which provides standard performance. However, the native implementation can achieve up to 120 FPS.

It's super important that scroll-driven animations run smoothly and donâ€™t get interrupted because "JavaScript is busy" doing who knows what.\

When integrating a CMS, different pages need access to the same variables, such as the API key. Now with Global Data Variables, they only need to be defined once, significantly improving the setup time and maintenance of a CMS.

Want to define a data variable outside of a Slot and use it within? Now you can! Useful for defining emails, resources, languages, and more outside of the slot but using them in footers, navs, and more.
