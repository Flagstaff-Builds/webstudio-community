# ðŸ†• September Update

## 1. Paste from Webflow

We added the ability to copy elements in Webflow and paste them in Webstudio. Copying and pasting is a huge efficiency booster for any tool, especially in the coding world. We are trying to incorporate as much copy-pasting functionality into the builder as possible to speed up your workflows.\
\
Previously, you were able to copy and paste [Markdown](../university/foundations/copy-paste/markdown.md), copy and paste Webstudio instances between pages and projects, and now we've added the ability to [copy and paste from Webflow](../university/foundations/copy-paste/webflow.md) into Webstudio (there are some [limitations](../university/foundations/copy-paste/webflow.md#what-does-and-doesnt-transfer)).  See the [announcement on X](https://x.com/getwebstudio/status/1813282002503619009).

## 2. Static Site Export

With [this update](https://x.com/getwebstudio/status/1820504786820903159), we made [self-hosting static sites](../university/self-hosting/#static-site) for free SUPER EASY.

Webstudio is more than a static site builder, its for dynamic, data-driven sites and apps, but you can still build great static sites with it and we made it possible to export a static site.&#x20;

* One-click download
* Human-readable classes â€“ Host anywhere (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, etc.)
* Downloads Dynamic Resource data for you
* Free to use

You can also use the [CLI](../university/self-hosting/cli.md) to build a static site.

## 3. Components search & new keyboard shortcuts

Now you can quickly access components from the keyboard and insert them. \
\
`A` - opens the components panel, where you can start typing right away\
`Z` - opens navigator\
`S` - opens the style panel\
`D` - opens the settings panel\
\
Read about all [available shortcuts](../university/foundations/shortcuts.md).

## 4. Image transformations for 3rd party URLs

With this update, you can use a remote image URL with the [Image component](../university/core-components/image.md), for example when working with APIs, and it will be transformed on the fly to an optimal format (e.g., WebP or AVIF) and rendered responsively depending on the viewport size.

## 5. Markdown Embed Component

With [this update](https://x.com/getwebstudio/status/1822270103452319872), we added a "[Markdown Embed](../university/core-components/markdown-embed.md)" component. Now you can render and style Markdownâ€”whether it's written directly in Webstudio or fetched from any CMS. It is 100% server-side, SEO friendly!

## 6. Headless CMS finder

To help you find the right CMS for your needs, we launched a [CMS finder tool](https://wstd.us/cms-finder) which gives you an easy way to filter.
