# Marketplace

See [Webstudio Templates](https://webstudio.is/marketplace/templates) or head over to the Builder to view all templates.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Marketplace in the Builder contains more templates than what's shown in the Dashboard. The Dashboard shows starter Projects, while the Builder shows everything in the Dashboard, plus pages and sections.
{% endhint %}

## Types of templates

### **Pages**

Page templates are pre-designed single or multi-page layouts for entire pages. Upon selection, a new page will be inserted into your Project.

### **Integrations**

Integration templates are [pages](marketplace.md#pages) with preconfigured [Resources](foundations/variables.md#resource), such as Airtable, Notion, Ghost, Baserow, and more.

Blog templates, for example, typically include pages like:

* Posts
* Post
* Author
* Tag
* Sitemap

Integration templates are typically unstyled or minimally styled, allowing you to apply your own design while providing the backend API connections.

### **Sections**

Section templates are pre-designed layouts for quickly creating pages from sections. Upon selection, the section is inserted into the current page.

## Webflow Ecosystem Compatibility

Webstudio supports templates, component libraries, and projects from the Webflow ecosystem, allowing you to copy from Webflow and paste into Webstudio. Learn more about [Copy Paste](foundations/copy-paste/webflow.md).

You can contribute free or paid templates by creating a project and submitting it for review.
