# Using Custom Fonts in Webstudio

Webstudio lets you use custom fonts without relying on third-party services like Google Fonts. You can either choose from built-in font stacks or upload your own font files.

## Can I use custom font files?

**Yes** ‚Äî you can upload your own fonts directly inside the Webstudio interface, no external hosting required.

## How to add custom fonts

1. Select any text element on your canvas.
2. In the **Typography** section of the **Style Panel**, click the **cloud upload icon** next to the font family dropdown.
3. The **Fonts menu** will open. From here you can:
   - Choose from **Modern Font Stacks**
   - Pick a **system font**
   - Click **Upload** to add your own font files (e.g. `.woff`, `.woff2`, `.ttf`)

## What are "Modern Font Stacks"?

Webstudio includes built-in support for [Modern Font Stacks](https://modernfontstacks.com/), which are fast, system-based font combinations designed to look good across platforms. They‚Äôre a great alternative to web-hosted fonts and help improve page load speed and privacy.
