  Design Tokens enable the creation of consistent designs by packaging up
  multiple styles so that on any instance you add that Token, those styles will
  show up and stay in sync.

## Why Tokens instead of classes? <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

If you‚Äôve ever made a website with CSS or with Webflow, you‚Äôve used ‚Äúclasses‚Äù to manage your website‚Äôs layout and visual styles. Sometimes we love classes. They give us a way to re-use styles which saves us valuable time. However, they have some limitations that make classes very frustrating to use in the context of visual development tools.

Scenario: You‚Äôre building a website with Webflow. You have two separate elements, a button, and a card, and you want to give them the same box shadow. Buttons and cards have unique styles so they each already have a unique class. What do you do?

* A: Manually configure the box shadow on the existing Button and Card classes individually. With this option you‚Äôre doing the same thing twice. It would save time if we could reuse the box shadow styles.
* B: Apply the Box Shadow class on top of the existing Button and Card classes, making a combo class. Now you can‚Äôt edit the styles on Button or Card without first removing the Box Shadow class. Don‚Äôt forget to re-apply it! And good luck managing the classes on a different breakpoint. To edit the Button or Card classes you must first remove the Box Shadow combo class, then Webflow will kick you back to the desktop breakpoint, then you select the intended breakpoint again, then make your style changes, then re-apply the combo class. Experienced Webflowers know the pain.

There‚Äôs a better way. It‚Äôs Design Tokens.

## What are Design Tokens? <a href="#what-are-design-tokens" id="what-are-design-tokens"></a>

Design Tokens are everything that you wish classes would be - a way to reuse styles without limitations.

* **Mix-and-match Tokens freely**: You can apply as many Tokens as you want to an instance in any order. There is no combo class silliness and no limitations with breakpoints.
* **Universal format:** We didn‚Äôt invent Design Tokens. There is an independent spec (by the [Design Tokens Community Group](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/)) that defines a data format for Tokens, meaning you can potentially import and export tokens between multiple apps. Soon you‚Äôll be able to sync tokens between Webstudio and Figma through the [Tokens Studio for Figma](https://tokens.studio/) plugin!

## How to use Tokens <a href="#how-to-use-tokens-in-webstudio" id="how-to-use-tokens-in-webstudio"></a>

The workflow for styling Tokens in Webstudio is nearly the same as styling classes in Webflow, except better.

First, it's recommended to create [CSS variables](css-variables.md) to use within the Tokens.

You can style your site using Local or Tokens like this:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/style-sources.png" alt="Style sources" data-size="original"></td><td>The top of the Style Panel contains Style Sources. Here is where you can add new Tokens, select existing ones, and switch to Local styling.</td><td>The top section of the Style Panel is our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/148kfyt/psa_consolescontrollerbeginners_users/">Style Sources Input</a>. This is where you‚Äôll create, style, and arrange your tokens.<br><br>When you select a component's instance on the canvas, the tokens you see inside this input are <em>sources</em> of the <em>styles</em> on that instance.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/convert-to-token.png" alt="Convert local to token" data-size="original"></td><td>Want to style something immediately without making a Token? Use the Local Style Source. Styles applied on Local only impact that instance, but you can easily convert styles from Local to a new Token.</td><td>Want to style something immediately without making a token? Go for it. All component instances in Webstudio have this Local style source by default. Styles applied on Local are unique to an instance and can‚Äôt be re-used, but you can easily convert styles from Local to a new token through the token menu.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/new-token.png" alt="Adding a new token" data-size="original"></td><td>To make a new Token, click inside the Style Sources input, type a name, and hit enter.</td><td>To make a new token, click inside the Style Sources Input, type a name, and hit ENTER/RETURN.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/tokens-added.png" alt="Switching tokens" data-size="original"></td><td>The Token you‚Äôre currently styling will be blue in the Style Sources input, while others are gray. Simply click on another style source to select it. Any styling you do will be applied to the current Token and reflected across all instances of that Token.</td><td><p>The token you‚Äôre currently styling will be blue in the Style Sources Input, while others are gray.

This will go away as soon as you apply a style. For Local, a dot is added to the center of the circle when styles are added.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Exporting human-readable classes

By default, Tokens are converted to atomic styles, significantly reducing the amount of CSS, ultimately leading to a faster-loading website.

While the majority of users aren't concerned with how the classes are output and should use atomic styles, they can be optionally disabled.

See [Atomic CSS](project-settings.md#atomic-css) for more info.
