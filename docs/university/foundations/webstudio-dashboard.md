Welcome to your Webstudio Dashboard! Here's a quick guide to help you navigate and make the most of the features available:

## Your Profile & Tier Level:
At the top, you'll notice a user icon. Clicking on this icon will reveal your current subscription tier. If you're looking to access more features or increase your project limits, there's also an option to upgrade your tier. Additionally, you can sign out from your account here.

## Resources
Below your profile, you'll find a curated list of resources. This includes instructional YouTube videos, a link to comprehensive GitBook documentation, and an invitation to join our vibrant Discord community. There's also an option to follow along on our X platform for real-time updates or discuss topics on GitHub. These resources are designed to support your learning journey and connect you with fellow creators.

## Projects
he core of the dashboard is dedicated to your projects. Here, you can start a new project with the click of a button or delve into existing projects by selecting them. Each project card displays a customizable screenshot, the project title, a direct link to the Webstudio live version, the creation date, and options to duplicate, rename, share, or delete your project. This section is your workspace, where your ideas come to life.

## Templates
Kickstart your projects with the Templates section, where we offer a variety of pre-designed website templates. These templates are a great starting point for your projects, allowing you to dive straight into customization without starting from scratch.
